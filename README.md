Design Patterns Labs
=========

## Provided Java Code

This project provides few basic classes to be used during the "Design Pattern" labs.  


#### Core classes

`eu.telecomnancy.ISensor`: An interface that brand new sensor must implement.  
`eu.telecomnancy.SensorNotActivatedException`: An exception that is thrown when a sensor is not in the right mood ;)  
`eu.telecomnancy.TemperatureSensor`: An brand new temperature sensor implementing `ISensor` interface.  
`eu.telecomnancy.LegacyTemperatureSensor`: A old implementation of a temperature sensor.  

#### Command line client application

`eu.telecomnancy.App`: A basic command line interface (CLI) to control a temperature sensor (implementing `ISensor` interface).  
`eu.telecomnancy.ui.ConsoleUI`: A class that manages command line user interaction.  

#### Swing client application

`eu.telecomnancy.SwingApp`: A basic Swing application that displays a temperature sensor (implementing `ISensor` interface).  
`eu.telecomnancy.ui.SensorWindow`: A tiny sensor view that provides some basic controls.  
`eu.telecomnancy.ui.MainWindow`: The main window of the swing application that display only one sensor view.  

#### Helper Classes

`eu.telecomnancy.ReadPropertyFile`: A class to show how to read a property file in the class path
